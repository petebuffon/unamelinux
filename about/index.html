<p>I am an aspiring sys admin, coder, and Linux enthusiast.</p>
<p>Over the past five years or so I&rsquo;ve become increasingly interested in computers.  It all started with a long time dream of building my own computer, which I accomplished in 2014.  I grew up with Macs, but I began to have an itch to tinker and I found myself installing Ubuntu on my new desktop rig.  This path eventually led to installing Arch, but nowadays I find myself going back and forth between Fedora and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Curiosity is one of the main driving forces in my life.  I consider myself a scientist first, a student and observer of everything life has to offer.  I majored in Cell Biology for undergrad and have a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Viticulture and Enology.  I worked in the wine industry for about eight years and now I&rsquo;m looking at starting a new chapter in my life.</p>
<p>Using the knowledge and skills I&rsquo;ve learned so far I&rsquo;m ready to accelerate my path forward and move into a career in tech.  So far I have gone with a jack of all trades approach in order to gain a broad sense of the industry before diving into individual topics.  However, I have a definite interest in networking, containers, and security.</p>
<p>My goal for this blog is to record my wandering journey through the world of technology.  I&rsquo;m excited to explore the breadth of the internet looking for new hardware to assemble, skills to learn, and software to install. My expected release cadence for this blog is about every two weeks.</p>
<p>The topics this blog will cover include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux, BSD, and Windows</li>
<li>Infosec</li>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Home servers</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Containers</li>
<li>Programming languages such as Bash and Python</li>
</ul>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not behind a terminal I enjoy hiking, playing video games, and exploring new food and beer spots with my wife.</p>
