      <description>Containers have radically changed how computer systems and applications are built, managed, and deployed. At home I deploy a combination of containers and VMs for my own personal use.
Building Blocks While similar to virtualization, containers have several key differences. Each virtual machine created by a hypervisor has its own kernel and emulated hardware. Containers share the same kernel as the host and isolate application processes from the rest of the system.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my Dell XPS 13 for about six months now and thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick review and summarize some of the tweaks I&amp;rsquo;ve made over time. In August 2019 I purchased a Developer Edition Dell XPS 13 9380 which came with Dell&amp;rsquo;s version of Ubuntu pre-installed. Preferring Canonical&amp;rsquo;s stock version of Ubuntu, the first thing I did was install Ubuntu 19.04 on the new laptop.
The screen of the XPS 13 is fantastic with great color and clarity.</description>

      <title>Simple Samba</title>

      <description>As a first post I thought I would tackle a topic I initially avoided for quite a while, Samba. Setting up a Samba server can be incredibly simple and is a great first step to setting up your own personal cloud at home.
Sharing files via Samba allows me to go from my desktop to my laptop without skipping a beat. I can also feel at ease because my sensitive files are password protected and remain solely on the LAN.</description>
