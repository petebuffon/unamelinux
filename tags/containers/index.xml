      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve messed around with Podman every now and then and watched it&amp;rsquo;s development over the last few years, but haven&amp;rsquo;t used it extensively. With Podman&amp;rsquo;s release of version 2.1.0, I thought it would be a great time to explore the project further.
  Podman is an open-source daemonless container engine alternative to Docker. We could simply substitute podman in for docker:
$ alias docker=podman However, Podman also has a number of features that set it a part from Docker.</description>

      <title>Gunicorn and Flask</title>

      <description>Web applications seem to be everywhere nowadays. Python is my go to programming language and so I thought I would build a web application using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. Starting out with Flask is simple enough, but if you want advanced features such as database integration or user logins, then you will either have to build them yourself or rely on the rich Flask extension community.
I recently finished CS50: Introduction to Computer Science class on edX.</description>

      <title>Reverse Proxies</title>

      <description>A reverse proxy is a server application that sits in front of one or more web servers and forwards client requests to those web servers. Reverse proxies can be used for (but are not limited to):
 offloading web server TLS encryption reducing server loads by caching static and dynamic content optimizing web content with compression adding basic HTTP access authentication to web servers allowing traffic to multiple web servers though a single IP address  For this post I will set up a reverse proxy on an Ubuntu 20.</description>

      <description>Organizations spanning more than one site often use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect sensitive data sent from site to site. VPNs allow private networks to be extended across a public network. Most software VPN implementations utilize encryption to further protect data in transit.
Two of the most common VPNs, IPsec and OpenVPN, are long established and feature rich, but often difficult to set up and deploy. A while ago I attempted to set up a IPsec VPN on my home pfSense firewall, but gave up because of the complex authentication setup required.</description>

      <description>Continuing the container series naturally brings us to LXC and LXD. For a background on Linux Containers and an introduction to Docker, see Linux Containers and Docker. The rest of the container series posts can be found here.
 LXC   Engineers from IMB developed LXC in 2008. LXC layered userspace tooling on top of the already existing cgroups and namespace technologies. While LXC improved the user experience of deploying containers, security remained an obstacle with the threat of users being able to break out of containers and attack the host system.</description>

      <description>If you need a refresher here are the first two posts in the series, Linux Containers and Docker and Docker Compose and Volumes.
Before moving on to other Linux container platforms, I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on one more Docker command, docker build. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to slightly alter existing images, or create entirely new images not available on the Docker Hub. Building images is relatively straight forward once you get a feel for the syntax of Docker images.</description>

      <description>In the first post of the container series Linux Containers and Docker, I introduced Linux Containers and Docker, as well as how to use the Docker CLI and basic management of containers. In this second post of the series I turn my focus to my favorite Docker management tool, Docker Compose.
  Docker Compose is a container management tool for Docker, written in Python, and it is a game changer.</description>

      <description>Containers have radically changed how computer systems and applications are built, managed, and deployed. At home I deploy a combination of containers and VMs for my own personal use.
 Building Blocks While similar to virtualization, containers have several key differences. Each virtual machine created by a hypervisor has its own kernel and emulated hardware. Containers share the same kernel as the host and isolate application processes from the rest of the system.</description>
