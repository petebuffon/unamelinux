      <description>Organizations spanning more than one site often use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect sensitive data sent from site to site. VPNs allow private networks to be extended across a public network. Most software VPN implementations utilize encryption to further protect data in transit.
Two of the most common VPNs, IPsec and OpenVPN, are long established and feature rich, but often difficult to set up and deploy. A while ago I attempted to set up a IPsec VPN on my home pfSense firewall, but gave up because of the complex authentication setup required.</description>

      <description>Continuing the container series naturally brings us to LXC and LXD. For a background on Linux Containers and an introduction to Docker, see Linux Containers and Docker. The rest of the container series posts can be found here.
 LXC   Engineers from IMB developed LXC in 2008. LXC layered userspace tooling on top of the already existing cgroups and namespace technologies. While LXC improved the user experience of deploying containers, security remained an obstacle with the threat of users being able to break out of containers and attack the host system.</description>
