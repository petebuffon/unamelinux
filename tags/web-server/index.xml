      <description>OpenSSL is a wide spread open source cryptographic software library that contains implementations of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. Today most open source security applications utilize OpenSSL.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is encrypted using TLS or its predecessor SSL. Encryption of HTTP traffic helps protect against man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks and is a powerful security tool for deploying applications, even those that never see public access.</description>

      <description>In the first post of the container series Linux Containers and Docker, I introduced Linux Containers and Docker, as well as how to use the Docker CLI and basic management of containers. In this second post of the series I turn my focus to my favorite Docker management tool, Docker Compose.
  Docker Compose is a container management tool for Docker, written in Python, and it is a game changer.</description>

      <description>Containers have radically changed how computer systems and applications are built, managed, and deployed. At home I deploy a combination of containers and VMs for my own personal use.
 Building Blocks While similar to virtualization, containers have several key differences. Each virtual machine created by a hypervisor has its own kernel and emulated hardware. Containers share the same kernel as the host and isolate application processes from the rest of the system.</description>
