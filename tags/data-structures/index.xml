      <description>I initially thought Python list comprehensions were obtuse and unnecessary, a bit of syntactic sugar I didn&amp;rsquo;t need, but after spending more time with them my opinion has completely flipped. Now I not only use them as much as I can, but I also want to get the word out for those who might not know about them.
