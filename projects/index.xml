      <description>Simple custom wordlist generator Scuwl (skull) is a Python CLI program that quickly and easily generates a wordlist from a webpage. The idea for Scuwl was inspired by the program Cewl. Scuwl defaults to a crawling depth of zero and most webpages return a wordlist in less than a second. Using a crawling depth of one generally takes a few minutes.
Scuwl is fast because it recursively scrapes websites asynchronously. Scuwl minimizes its memory footprint by processing HTML as it goes and updating the wordlist in memory as a set.</description>
